    "Instance-based learning algorithms memorize the training data and make predictions based on similarity with new data points. They do not create an explicit model but instead rely on distance metrics or similarity functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Feateres\n",
    "* Stores training data and compares new inputs with stored examples.\n",
    "* Uses distance-based metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.\n",
    "* Quick to adapt to new data but slow during prediction.\n",
    "* Requires more memory since all data is stored.\n",
    "  \n",
    "###  Examples of Instance-Based Algorithms\n",
    "*  k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) – Finds the \"k\" closest training points to predict a new instance.\n",
    "*  Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Uses support vectors (specific instances) to define decision boundaries.\n",
    "* Fits a model locally around each test point. "
