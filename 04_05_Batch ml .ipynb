    "# Batch learning\n",
    "Batch learning, also known as offline learning, is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained on the entire dataset at once, rather than incrementally updating with new data over time. This is in contrast to online learning, where the model continuously updates as new data arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of Batch Learning\n",
    "* Trained on a Fixed Dataset: The model is trained using a fixed dataset and does not change until it is retrained with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computationally Intensive: Since the entire dataset is used for training, it requires significant computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not Adaptable to Real-Time Changes: The model does not learn from new data unless explicitly retrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suitable for Large Datasets: Best for scenarios where data does not change frequently or real-time learning is not required."

    "# Online Learning (Incremental Learning)\n",
    "Online learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model learns continuously from streaming or new incoming data. Unlike batch learning, which trains on a fixed dataset, online learning updates the model iteratively as new data arrives.\n",

    "## Examples of Online Learning\n",

    "*  Autonomous Vehicles – Self-driving cars update their decision models in real-time using sensor data.\n",
